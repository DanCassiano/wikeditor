The Canadian weather for bringing out a red flag during the F1 race,
it was a perfect moment to start developing this.

theTeam, who is paying for hosting. Hosted on S3, which is why the url's
www.spritecow.com rather than just spritecow.com, can't do a cname for that :(

The 08:03 Southern service from Haywards Heath to London Bridge for always
having a table seat, where the majority of this was developed.
